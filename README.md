### What I learned

I learned how to import and work with google fonts, work with a figma file, read and understand figma file dimensions and what is meant by HUG. I made a container with height and width set to "fit-content" along with a max-width and max height. Makes container responsive to text inside container. Learned how to center a div vertically and horizontally in contraints of parent container. Added box-shadow and border-radius AND a basic media query to deal with mobile @ stated screen width. Also this project required basic hovering state.
